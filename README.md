# matplotlib-challenge

# This project is an assignment by Andrew Belfiglio in the Data Science and Data Visualizations bootcamp at the University of Pennsylvania in collaboration with edX.

# This repository contains the Pymaceuticals challenge. Pymaceuticals contains data from an animal model anti-cancer study, in which 249 mice were treated with one of ten treatments (including placebo). Tumor observations of each mouse were made for up to 45 days each. The analysis summarizes the study population, results by drug regimen, and graphs data regarding the company's drug of interest: Capomulin.

# The main analysis and code can be found in the pymaceuticals.ipynb file. The original raw data contains two csv files in the Resources subfolder.

# This code is original and is based on the curriculum of the bootcamp program.
